# HungarianWin Keyboard Layout (Modified)

## Description
This is a modified version of the HungarianWin macOS keyboard layout. The original file is sourced from:
[HungarianWin.keylayout](https://github.com/StrictLine/MacOSX-KeyboardLayout_WinHUN/blob/master/configs/HungarianWin.keylayout)

The only modification made is the correction of the **√≠ (small i acute) and √ç (capital I acute)** characters, so that:
- Pressing the key next to Shift produces **√≠**
- Pressing Shift + the key produces **√ç**

## Installation
1. Copy the modified `HungarianWinMod.keylayout` file to:
   ```
   ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/
   ```
2. Restart your Mac or log out and back in.
3. Go to **System Preferences** ‚Üí **Keyboard** ‚Üí **Input Sources**.
4. Add the new layout from **Other** or **Hungarian**.
5. Switch to the new keyboard layout and start typing!

## Acknowledgments
Original layout by [StrictLine](https://github.com/StrictLine). Only minor modifications were made to fix the √≠/√ç characters.

Enjoy typing in Hungarian on macOS with a Windows-like experience! üòä
